# Crafting Your Perfect Celebration

At The Artisan Bakery, we believe every celebration deserves a centerpiece that tastes as good as it looks. Our custom cake process is designed to be seamless and collaborative.

## 1. Choose Your Occasion
Whether it's an elegant 3-tier wedding cake for a Lavington ceremony or a fun-themed birthday cake for a party in Westlands, we tailor our designs to your specific needs.

## 2. Select Your Flavor Profile
From our signature **Belgian Chocolate Ganache** to our **Fresh Passion Fruit Sponge**, all our cakes are made with premium, locally sourced ingredients.

## 3. Consultation & Design
For large events, we offer a private consultation at our Sarit Centre cafe. We'll discuss your theme, guest count, and any dietary requirements (including gluten-free and vegan options).

## 4. Delivery & Set-up
We provide professional delivery and on-site set-up across Nairobi to ensure your cake arrives in pristine condition.
